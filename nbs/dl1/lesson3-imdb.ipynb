       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

That model has been trained to guess what the next word is, its input being all the previous words. It has a recurrent structure and a hidden state that is updated each time it sees a new word. This hidden state thus contains information about the sentence up to that point.\n",

Plus there might be some words that would be extremely common in the reviews dataset but would be barely present in wikipedia, and therefore might not be part of the vocabulary the model was trained on."

       "xxbos i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . xxmaj this happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called xxmaj clerks late one night on television . xxmaj the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . xxmaj when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was xxmaj clerks , i started to get interesting . xxmaj when he said his main influence was xxmaj the xxmaj station xxmaj agent , a movie i 'd seen on xxup dvd a week prior , i decided i had to go and check it out . xxmaj the result could be described along the same lines as xxmaj clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . xxmaj both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . xxmaj whereas xxmaj clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , xxmaj less xxmaj like xxmaj me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . xxmaj the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . xxmaj the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . xxmaj as far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close .,xxbos xxmaj david xxmaj webb xxmaj peoples meets xxmaj paul xxmaj anderson ... if it already sounds weird to you , then you are right , because it is . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong , the value of life , etc ... xxmaj he covered these issues in xxmaj bladerunner , xxmaj unforgiven , and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj paul xxmaj anderson 's first successful movie was a violent thriller . xxmaj not surprisingly so have all of his other movies ! xxmaj and here is a violent thriller with moral implications ! \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj peoples ' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie . xxmaj soldiers trained from birth , taught to kill , and never had a normal life . xxmaj they are replaced by better , genetically engineered soldiers and xxmaj todd , one of the original soldiers , is left on a planet and left for dead . xxmaj there he must cope with a group of refugees , some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here . xxup but xxup then ... \n",

       "  ... xxmaj the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people . xxmaj big , violent , loud action ensues and xxmaj peoples ' script turns into an xxmaj anderson action - fest . xxmaj it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way , but the end product is better then i expected . xxmaj entertaining , somewhat , though admittedly not very , thought - provoking , and exciting once the action starts . 7 / 10 \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxup beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight - faced exploit film . a couple of xxmaj yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion . xxmaj as this nastiness is going on , the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in xxmaj africa , and that they 're gon na do the same to her . xxmaj they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more . xxmaj she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story . xxmaj the rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide . xxmaj the clinic worker , moved by the young lady 's story , decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower - level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the xxmaj yakuza leaders . xxmaj this whole plan backfires , so now xxmaj ms. xxmaj vigilante - xxmaj clinic - xxmaj worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse ( some pretty rough butt - rape ensues along with the pre - requisite gang rape ... ) . xxmaj she too is drugged , but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim xxrep 5 - it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic xxup blood xxup demon ! ! ! ( no sh!t , that 's what really happens ! ! ! ) xxmaj this is when xxup beauty really takes off with some pretty f!cking insane kill scenes - including a very classy chest - burst - rape that looks like a cross between xxup alien and a bad porn , and my favorite - a head - engulfed - by - demon - vagina kill ( complete with demon vagina - slime ... xxunk has to be seen to be believed ... \n",

       "xxbos i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . xxmaj this happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called xxmaj clerks late one night on television . xxmaj the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . xxmaj when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was xxmaj clerks , i started to get interesting . xxmaj when he said his main influence was xxmaj the xxmaj station xxmaj agent , a movie i 'd seen on xxup dvd a week prior , i decided i had to go and check it out . xxmaj the result could be described along the same lines as xxmaj clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . xxmaj both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . xxmaj whereas xxmaj clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , xxmaj less xxmaj like xxmaj me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . xxmaj the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . xxmaj the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . xxmaj as far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close .,xxbos xxmaj david xxmaj webb xxmaj peoples meets xxmaj paul xxmaj anderson ... if it already sounds weird to you , then you are right , because it is . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong , the value of life , etc ... xxmaj he covered these issues in xxmaj bladerunner , xxmaj unforgiven , and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines . \n",
       " \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj peoples ' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie . xxmaj soldiers trained from birth , taught to kill , and never had a normal life . xxmaj they are replaced by better , genetically engineered soldiers and xxmaj todd , one of the original soldiers , is left on a planet and left for dead . xxmaj there he must cope with a group of refugees , some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here . xxup but xxup then ... \n",

( no sh!t , that 's what really happens ! ! ! ) xxmaj this is when xxup beauty really takes off with some pretty f!cking insane kill scenes - including a very classy chest - burst - rape that looks like a cross between xxup alien and a bad porn , and my favorite - a head - engulfed - by - demon - vagina kill ( complete with demon vagina - slime ... xxunk has to be seen to be believed ... \n",
